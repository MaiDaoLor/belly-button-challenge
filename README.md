# Belly-Button-Challenge

In this assignment, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions
1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL (https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json).

2. Use the app.js provided in the [starter code file] (Static\js), create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

## Hint

* Use console.log inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.
